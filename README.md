DKeeper: ICP Blockchain Note Taking App


DKeeper is a decentralized note-taking application built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain. It allows users to create, store, and manage their notes securely on the blockchain. 
While the project is still a work in progress, this README provides an overview of its functionalities and how to use them.

Introduction
DKeeper is designed to provide users with a secure and decentralized platform for storing their notes on the ICP blockchain. It utilizes the power of smart contracts to ensure that notes are stored transparently and immutably.

Features
Adding Notes: Users can add new notes by providing a title and content for the note. The note is then stored securely on the ICP blockchain.

Storing Notes: All added notes are stored in a list structure on the blockchain, ensuring their persistence and availability.

Reading Notes: Users can query the application to retrieve a list of all their stored notes. This allows easy access to their notes whenever needed.

Deleting Notes (Work in Progress): A functionality for deleting notes is planned for future development, adding a comprehensive set of management features.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have access to an Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain environment.
Installation
Clone the DKeeper repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dkeeper.git
cd dkeeper
Set up your ICP development environment following the instructions provided by the ICP documentation.

Usage
Adding Notes
To add a new note, use the addingNotes function by providing a title and content for the note.

Reading Notes
You can query the application using the readNotes function to retrieve a list of all your stored notes. This list will contain the title and content of each note.

Deleting Notes (Work in Progress)
Deleting notes functionality is currently under development.
